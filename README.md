# Sorting-Algorithm

Quick sort:
  i.  We split a group up into two teams, making the person in the middle the referee.  Once we have teams, we give each player a position on the team based on their size.  Players are then given numbered jerseys; the smallest player gets the jersey with the lowest number and the largest player the opposite.  The two teams, with the referee in the middle, then meet together again as a group to play the game.

  ii.  function quickSort( an array )
         declare left and right variables and initialize each as empty arrays

         if the input to the function is not an array, throw an error

         find the value at the middle index of the array and save it to a variable called pivot

         iterate through the values of the array, pushing values into 'left' or 'right' if the numbers are less than or greater than the pivot index
